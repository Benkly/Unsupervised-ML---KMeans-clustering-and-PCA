# Unsupervised-ML---KMeans-clustering-and-PCA
An assignment completed as part of a training course in machine learning in the context of data analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used for dimensionality reduction of a 13-dimensional wine dataset. The coarse-grained system was used in a KMeans clustering algorithm to identify distinct clusters in the dataset corresponding to different brands of wine.
